# Tic Tac Toe - Naughts and Crosses
---
*The classic game to pass the time. Take turn marking boxes until one player has 3 in a row or all boxes are marked. (e.g. a draw)*

## Features
- 2 player turn based action!
- fun for the whole family (in groups of two)
- hot seat mode - player 1 clicks then player 2
- sunglasses at night dark mode (who needs light mode amirite?)

## Approach
Separate logic for the UI and the game data.
More spaghetti than you can shave a parmesan at.

## Technology
- HTML - page structure
- CSS - styling
- JS - game logic
- jQuery - dom manipulation, animations
- Canva - visual assets
- Github - version control

## Known Bugs
The backgrounds of the winner/draw splash animations are a little dodgy.
